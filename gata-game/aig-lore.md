### Planet Apelandia - The Three Archipelagos

Apelandia is an **ocean planet** that consists of **3 main archipelagos**:

* [Northern Archipelago](aig-lore.md#northern-archipelago-home-of-the-grey-apes): The Northern Archipelago contains the coldest regions of Apelandia and is the only archipelago with actual ice on Apelandia - the home of the [Grey Apes](aig-lore.md#nova-and-the-grey-apes-jupiters-fury). In the north of the archipelago, a _portal to Jupiter_ is located at the [Obsidian Ice Plate](aig-lore.md#obsidian-ice-plate-landmark-of-the-northern-archipelago-and-portal-to-jupiter).
* [Equatorian Archipelago](aig-lore.md#equatorian-archipelago-home-of-the-golden-apes): The Equatorian Archipelago is filled with tropical islands, dense jungles and all kinds of creatures & natural resources - the home of the [Golden Apes](aig-lore.md#solus-and-the-golden-apes-dirty-martian-dust). Close to the center of the archipelago, a _portal to Mars_ is located in the [Black Lagoon](aig-lore.md#black-lagoon-landmark-of-the-equatorian-archipelago-and-portal-to-mars).
* [Southern Archipelago](aig-lore.md#southern-archipelago-home-of-the-blue-apes): The Southern Archipelago is the biggest mining region on Apelandia, filled with valuable minerals and rare earths - the home of the [Blue Apes](aig-lore.md#atlas-and-the-blue-apes-amazonian-jungle-fever). In one of the oldest mining regions of the archipelago, a _portal to Earth_ is located within the [Endless Hole](aig-lore.md#endless-hole-landmark-of-the-southern-archipelago-and-portal-to-earth).&#x20;

<summary>Nova &#x26; the Grey Apes - “Jupiter’s Fury”</summary>

In the **Northern Archipelago,** the Grey Apes thrived amidst ice-capped mountains and sprawling tundras. The harsh conditions forged their adaptability and curiosity, yet their unpredictable environment engrained itself in the Grey Apes’ spirit. Led by their leader **Nova**, they excel in discovery, though sometimes struggle with consistency.

On the towering plateau of the **Obsidian Ice Plate**, the Grey Apes discovered a mysterious portal leading to **Jupiter**. Stepping through the light, they faced Jupiter's tempests. Harnessing their technological prowess and skills, they tamed the gas giant's chaos quickly, unveiling the mysteries of the ancient biodomes that glittered in the dark around Jupiter.

However, their cosmic explorations got disrupted by the **X Corporation**. Driven by reckless ambitions, the corporate leviathan's **deep-space miners** descended on Jupiter's moons like voracious locusts, heedless of ecological balance.

Recognizing the impending danger, Nova rallied the Grey Apes for a daring mission to place a treacherous **self-replicating minefield** in Jupiter's outer orbit. As X Corps massive mining fleet neared Jupiter, **Nova's strategic brilliance** and his tribe's **technological prowess** melded into a symphony of defense. The ensuing clash was a dance of pulsating energy beams and cunning maneuvers, illuminated against the backdrop of Jupiter's ferocious storms.

The Grey Apes' unwavering determination bore fruit, thwarting X Corps plundering aspirations. But amidst victory, a grim reality emerged like a dark specter, as **X had learned about Apelandia.** \
\
Haunted by the loss of captured kin and the looming threat of X Corps voracity, t**he Grey Apes returned through the portal**, resolved to safeguard their home from the approaching tempest of corporate exploitation.

<summary>Solus &#x26; the Golden Apes - “Dirty Martian Dust”</summary>



From the vibrant shores of the **Equatorian Archipelago**, the Golden Apes emerged and their lives intertwined with the tropical paradise surrounding them. Under the sun's embrace, they thrived, and their wisdom reflected in the lush landscapes of abundance around them. Guided by their wise leader **Solus**, the journey they were about to embark on seemed almost surreal.

Within the heart of the archipelago, a portal was discovered. The enigmatic **Black Lagoon**, a once tranquil oasis of reflection for the Golden Apes, transformed into a cosmic gateway to far-away **Mars**. As cautious as the Apes of Solus may be, they couldn’t contain the sparks of curiosity.

When the first brave souls of the Golden Apes stepped through the portal, they couldn’t believe their eyes. Nothing could have been more different to their home in Apelandia than the distant **Martian deserts**, which welcomed them with a reddish glow.&#x20;

Soon after their arrival, the Apes discovered an **ancient artifact** of a long lost civilization, unlocking the secrets of the cosmos. The artifact recognized Solus as guardian of knowledge and struck him with a data upload ray.&#x20;

Wondering about the sudden emergence of strange signals coming from the red planet, the crew of an **observation station** of X Corporation around Mars got curious and their orders were clear: X sought to harness ancient knowledge for their nefarious ambitions - at any & all costs.\


**Planetary landing pods** got launched, filled with heavily armed X Corp. mercenaries. Being made aware of the incoming drop ships by the ancient tech, Solus had to act quickly. He taught the other Golden Apes how to reactivate the few hidden **particle weapons** that were left after millenia of inactivity. Together they unleashed hell on the goons of X.\


Despite all odds and through their courage & wisdom, Solus and his crew managed to push back the mercenaries. The price of victory was high though, as many got killed & wounded. The Golden Apes had to return to Apelandia and Solus knew that X would be following soon - **a storm was brewing.**

<details>

<summary>Atlas &#x26; the Blue Apes - “Amazonian Jungle Fever”</summary>

In the thick jungles and azure waters of the **Southern Archipelago**, generations of hunters and miners turned the Blue Apes into the most muscular Apes of Apelandia. Yet, their impatience and emotional outbursts are as challenging as their oftentimes limited intellect. Led by their leader **Atlas**, their courage shines, though tempered by occasional recklessness.

At the center of the thick jungles of the Blue Apes’ archipelago lies the **Endless Hole**, considered to be the oldest mining facility on **Apelandia.** There had been stories about mysterious phenomena in the depths of this landmark for ages already, so the Blue Apes were not surprised when an actual portal to the stars appeared in one of its lowest shafts.

Atlas assembled a crew to venture forth, ready to face the unknown. The portal led them straight to the far-away **Earth** into the vast jungles of the Amazon. It felt almost like home - the vegetation as dense as rich, so strange, yet familiar.

It didn’t take long till the Blue Apes discovered that the Amazon had its own boundaries, not set by nature, but by corporate greed though. They witnessed how **X Corporation’s pioneer squads** burned down hills full of trees and wildlife with huge **flamethrower tanks.** Neither Atlas nor his Blue Apes had ever witnessed such environmental devastation before. Filled with anger, they decided to take a stand.

Utilizing their **incredible strength & strategic minds** to strike at the heart of X Corps in the Amazon, the Apes started a fierce battle. Ripping apart the pioneer’s of the corporate world.

Their following victory celebration between burned-out tanks didn’t last long though, as the Apes were not aware that their actions triggered alerts in every military installation across South America and that **drone swarms** were already approaching their position.

\
No matter their strength & courage, the following napalm bombardment took its toll, forcing the **Blue Apes’ retreat to Apelandia** with the threat of X looming right behind them.
