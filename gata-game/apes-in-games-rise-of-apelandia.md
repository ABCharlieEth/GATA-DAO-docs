#### Disclaimer&#x20;

Since this project is still at an early stage of the development process and may encounter delays or challenges, we strongly advise to see “Apes in Games” NFTs as collectible digital art pieces, often referred to as PFPs (Profile Pictures). The interactive P2E game is under development and will be released in the future. **Until then, please treat the NFTs as collectible items and not as ingame assets.**

As the project evolves, there is a possibility that certain features, rewards, or functionalities **may not align with initial expectations**. We are working hard to deliver an immersive and captivating experience, but unforeseen circumstances might result in **adjustments of the initial plan**.

Please be aware that the funds spent on minting “Apes in Games” NFTs are **non-refundable**. Minting an NFT is a commitment, and we urge everyone to consider their financial situation before participating in the mint.
