# Neutron

Neutron, a remarkable addition to the Cosmos ecosystem, opens up new horizons by seamlessly integrating Smart Contracts via the powerful CosmWasm technology. This innovation comes as a response to the growing need for increased functionality and interoperability within Cosmos-family blockchains. What sets Neutron apart is its approach to security, leveraging the Cosmos Hub's validator network for block validation. This eliminates the need for a separate set of validators, ensuring robust protection while simplifying network management.

Built upon the solid foundation of the Cosmos SDK, Neutron benefits from a framework renowned for its modularity and capabilities-based security. This foundation streamlines the development of secure blockchain applications, making Neutron a reliable and versatile addition to the Cosmos universe. Furthermore, Neutron introduces game-changing features like Interchain Queries (ICQs) and Interchain Accounts (ICAs) that empower smart contract developers. ICQs enable secure data retrieval from remote zones, while ICAs facilitate cross-zone transactions without the need for additional code deployment, making Neutron a hub for DeFi innovation. At its core, Neutron showcases the potential of the Cosmos ecosystem and its commitment to providing cutting-edge solutions to the blockchain world.\
