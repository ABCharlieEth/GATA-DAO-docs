# Stride

Stride zone; Cosmos ecosystem â€“ liquidity for staked tokens. Its primary function is to provide users with the opportunity to earn dual yields, combining staking and DeFi rewards across the Cosmos IBC ecosystem. The fundamental idea behind Stride is to empower users by offering immediate access to staked tokens when they liquid stake. These staked tokens accrue rewards in real-time, creating a dynamic and flexible asset that can be freely traded or redeemed through Stride, yielding native tokens along with staking rewards.

Behind the scenes, Stride autonomously stakes these tokens on the host chain, amplifying user rewards through compounding. Users can further boost their yields by participating in lending, liquidity provision, and more. Importantly, Stride ensures user freedom by allowing them to redeem their assets at any time. Upon redemption, Stride initiates the unbonding process on the host zone, culminating in the transfer of native tokens to the user's wallet once the unbonding period concludes.

The onboarding process for new chains is straightforward and democratic. Anyone can propose the integration of a new chain through a governance vote. If the proposal is accepted, the new chain is seamlessly integrated into Stride's ecosystem. Looking ahead, Stride has ambitious expansion plans, with an extensive list of chains and tokens slated for integration within the next year. This includes prominent projects such as Secret, Kava, Oasis, Akash, and many more. Stride, built on Cosmos SDK and Tendermint, is set to revolutionize liquidity provision and yield generation in the Cosmos IBC universe, offering users unparalleled financial opportunities.
