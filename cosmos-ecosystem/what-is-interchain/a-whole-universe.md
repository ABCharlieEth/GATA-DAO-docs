# A whole universe

The Interchain is an ever-expanding ecosystem of tokens, wallets, and tools, as well as interconnected applications and services, all built for a decentralized future.

In 2022, almost $100 billion in digital assets are under management and secured by the Interchain. Digital assets on the Interchain include fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You can issue in-application tokens to conduct settlements, bespoke issuance, handle inflation/deflation, and much more.

Among the fungible tokens secured by the Interchain are the [Binance Coin](https://www.binance.com/en/bnb) and [ATOM](https://cosmos.network/learn/faq/what-is-the-atom). Remember that because the tokens are defined on application-specific blockchains their developers are free from the constraints of a hypothetical general-purpose blockchain.

In addition to the vast number of tokens, a variety of applications, services, wallets, and explorers are Interchain-based.

Hundreds of applications and services build on the Interchain. Currently most applications and projects deal with finance, closely followed by infrastructure-related applications. Applications and projects in areas such as privacy, marketplace, and social impact are also emerging.

While most applications and projects are deployed on the mainnet, some are currently either in proof of concept, still in development, or have been deployed to a testnet only.

Moreover, [33 wallets](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/wallets/) and block explorers for the Interchain are part of the ecosystem. Most are for Android, such as the [Atomic Wallet](https://atomicwallet.io/) and [Coinex](https://www.coinex.com/en/), or for iOS, like [AirGap](https://airgap.it/) and [Wallet.io](https://walletio.io/), but you can also find a number of web wallets like [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/) and [Keplr](https://wallet.keplr.app/).
