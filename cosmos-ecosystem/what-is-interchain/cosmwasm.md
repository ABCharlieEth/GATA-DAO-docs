# CosmWasm

[CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) is a multi-chain solution for smart contracts on the Interchain - that is the Cosm part. It is a way of using WebAssembly in the Interchain universe - that is the Wasm part.

With CosmWasm you can create robust decentralized applications (dApps) for the Interchain using smart contracts and building on Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK. Its key features are:

* Mature tools for the development and testing of smart contracts
* Close integration with the Cosmos SDK and ecosystem
* A secure architecture to avoid attack vectors

CosmWasm's design makes your code agnostic to the details of the underlying chains. It only requires that a Cosmos SDK application embeds the Wasm module.

With CosmWasm, smart contracts can run on multiple chains with the help of the IBC protocol. It adds further flexibility for developers and makes smart contract development faster. CosmWasm is written as a module to be plugged into the Cosmos SDK and leverages the speed of Wasm and the power of Rust. CosmWasm is ideal for Rust developers looking for a blockchain platform with fast transaction finality.

All Ethereum tools (such as Truffle and Metamask) are compatible with Ethermint. Developers can even port their Solidity smart contracts to interact with the Interchain Ecosystem. Building a chain is not necessary to develop Interchain-compatible smart contracts, it can be all done with Ethermint. However, while Ethermint allows running vanilla Ethereum as a Cosmos application-specific blockchain, developers benefit from the CometBFT.
