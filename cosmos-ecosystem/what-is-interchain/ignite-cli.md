# Ignite CLI

[Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/) is a developer-friendly, command-line interface (CLI) tool for application-specific blockchains which builds on Tendermint/CometBFT and the Cosmos SDK. The CLI tool offers everything developers need to build, test, and launch a chain. It accelerates blockchain development by scaffolding and assembling all components needed for a production-ready blockchain. Ignite CLI makes the process from initial idea to production 95% faster. This lets developers build a blockchain in minutes, and frees them to focus more strongly on the business logic of their application.

With Ignite CLI, developers can:

* Create a modular blockchain written in Go with a single command.
* Start a development server to experiment with token creation and allocation, as well as module configuration.
* Allow for inter-chain token transfers by using a built-in IBC relayer to send value and data to different chains.
* Benefit from a fast-developed frontend with automatically generated APIs and web pages in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue.

When you scaffold with Ignite CLI, things like key management, creating validators, and transferring tokens can all be done through the CLI.
