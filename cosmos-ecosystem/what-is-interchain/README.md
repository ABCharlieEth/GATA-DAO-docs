# The Interchain Ecosystem

The Interchain is a network of independent blockchains, which are:

* All powered by consensus algorithms with Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (BFT).
* All connected through the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), which enables value transfers, token transfers, and other communication between chains, all without the need to involve exchanges or make compromises regarding the sovereignty of each chain.

The Interchain is also a blockchain ecosystem complete with protocols, SDK, tokens, wallets, applications, repositories, services, and tools.
