# Origin of Voyagers

We have been on the ground but calls are being made from space. We did our part on earth and took off. Colonial cats propelled us to reach the unending cosmos. I am here today to reveal our next station. The Voyager Cats, named after honourable astronauts without whom the exploration of the universe would have stayed in the imagination only. These are here to guide us for our next journey and all journeys to come that shall be in space.
