# Origin of γάτα

## Origin of **γάτα**

A few 100 years ago on the seas far far away, a new land space was discovered. The uncharted land was a new adventure and many seeked to conquer it. A new era of colonization began. Colonization was not an easy journey. It required sacrifices from everyone including farmers, miners, tradesmen, soldiers, religious and social groups, and a very few of the aristocracy. Only a few were victorious but others faced demise without knowing the powers behind those who marked the uncharted their own. The power that had hid itself until the world was ready for it was known as the Colonial Cats.

Behold, and let it be known that the Colonial Cats have emerged again to accept a few as worthy and make them succeed in the newly discovered territory, the space of crypto. The territory is so ferocious that many who tried besieging it are only in dust now. Nevertheless, Colonial Cats are astral. They hold multiple levels of power. Those who join them are allowed to share and wield those powers.

Now the question remains, are you ready to make yourself worthy of Colonial Cats?
