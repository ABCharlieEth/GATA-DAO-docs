**Prologue**

_There's a sense or logic to everything, right? So, how does Yield Gorilla comes in to play? How are they related to GATA? Who came first? All these questions are fitting!_&#x20;

_The saga of Gorillas is a bit different from GATA's. While GATA are from greek era of gods and each gata, as we have seen, possesses different powers, the Gorrilas are more of earthly creatures. They have lived and stayed in the common and modest habitat. This modest habitat is a place to which belongs everyone. You and me too, there is no royal patronage. Nonetheless, they are not scarce of royal blood. You may also observe that the habitat has affected the how the gorillas look. Their identity is not based on color but the environment; a bear, a bull, a moon. Gorillas identify themselves in a unique way because they belong to a unique space. Unique, modest and sometimes a cruel space. In this cruel space, the Gorillas have emerged to side those who recognize value. Do you recognize value?_  &#x20;

**The narrative**

ï»¿The DAO has launched the first non-GATA Yield series, the Yield Gorilla. The Yield Gorilla NFTs will derive their value from the staking rewards. The revenue from the mint will be, in total, staked on the GATA Validators and the rewards collected from staking will be distributed to the owners of the Yield Gorillas. A total of 10,000 Yield Gorillas will exist. Furthermore, the distribution of rewards will also depend on the rarity of the NFT.&#x20;

The community members of the DAO have been given priority, as always, for whitelisting as well as holders of the GATA series, delegators, and helpful community members have been awarded special prices for the non-GATA series. _click_ [_here_](https://medium.com/gatadao/yield-gorillas-serie-is-here-4ae0c2423017) _for detail on the Yield Gorillas Series._

The minting of the series began on 16 November 2022 in the order of whitelist categories. The minting for whitelisted addresses (Category 1, 2 and 3) finished in 4, 4 and 12 hours respectively. Afterward, the public minting started which is not time-bound.

The DAO understands that an owner of Gorilla or a potential holder of it will want to know the return on their investment. Therefore, we have prepared detailed [minting scenarios](https://medium.com/gatadao/yield-gorilla-rewards-calculation-21dc924787e3) where an estimate of monthly earnings can be determined.
