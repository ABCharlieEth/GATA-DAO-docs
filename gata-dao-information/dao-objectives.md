# â›½ DAO Objectives

## To operate as an NFT DAO

GATA DAO aims to function as a decentralized autonomous organization that leverages non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to govern its operations. The DAO's members will collectively own the validator nodes on various sovereign blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem, and the NFT holders will have a stake in the DAO's revenue streams.

## To generate passive income for NFT holders

By owning GATA NFTs, holders can receive a share of the DAO's revenue, enabling them to earn passive income without actively participating in the organization's operations. The DAO generates revenue by running [Validators](dao-ventures/gata-validators/) on different blockchains, staking different assets, and NFT holders can benefit from this revenue stream.

## To give back to the community

GATA DAO aims to be a community-driven organization that is focused on creating value for its members. By enabling NFT holders to earn passive income, the DAO is giving back to its community members and rewarding them for their participation in the organization

## To provide governance for the Cosmos ecosystem

As a validator node operator on different blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem, GATA DAO aims to provide reliable and secure infrastructure to support the development of the blockchain ecosystem. The DAO will use its collective governance power to make decisions that benefit the Cosmos community as a whole.
