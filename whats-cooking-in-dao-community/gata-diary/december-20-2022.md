**How has it been?**&#x20;

The year has been a total roller coaster for the GATA family. We began our journey during the decline of the bull market but had not expected the bear market too early thereafter. After the launch of our first collection the [Colonial Cats](../../about-gata-dao/projects-of-gata-ventures/gata-series/origin-of-gata.md) or the Original γάτα series, we launched two more collections; the [Voyager Cats](../../about-gata-dao/projects-of-gata-ventures/gata-series/origin-of-voyagers.md) and the non-gata yield series, the [Yield Gorilla](../../about-gata-dao/projects-of-gata-ventures/about-yield-gorilla/). One at the possible lowest of the bear market or at least when the fear meter was at extreme highs, the other when the seasonal trader had gone home.

**One step at a time**

Furthermore, although the Voyager Cats did not see the hundered percent mark and were taken to treasury for them to hibernate, the Yield Gorilla series followed the footsteps of the Colonial Cats. Yield Gorilla were sold out in less than a week. It's is a huge success since the quantity of collection was humungous. GATA-DAO has been taking care of the DAO family and this time, a special palce was given to the holders and delegators of the DAO. Whitelist with various benefits were given to the family which enabled them to participate in the minting of Yeild Gorrila in VIP mode. The heartfelt words from one of the core members of DAO in this regard can be read [here ](https://discord.com/channels/934972959913820160/938799758544343041/1047238843008561263)and to read more about Yield Gorrila see [this](https://medium.com/gatadao/yield-gorillas-serie-is-here-4ae0c2423017).

Another factor of progress which must not be overlooked is the number of sources of revenue. The DAO has been earning via validating many different projects and the sources of such earning has increased since 3rd distribution (the 3rd [Epoch](../../about-gata-dao/projects-of-gata-ventures/gata-dao/dao-revenue-distribution.md#gata-dao-epoch-3)). This will continue to grow in the future because DAO is striving for consistet and solid growth in the year that is to start. DAO has also started to validate on Osmosis, you can delegate to DAO [here](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/validators/osmovaloper1d5ada26tcd24wltfakqkkdu3656k6n4chnyz8h) and be a part of our family if not already.

Lastly, but not the least, the most recent benefits to the GATA family includes significant Crew3 rewards (see [here](https://discord.com/channels/934972959913820160/938799758544343041/1053081320194064505)), consmons airdrop and rewards for Tori delegators (each week untill the end of the campaign, see [here](https://discord.com/channels/934972959913820160/938799758544343041/1053765302883733665) the latest announcement).



_**The hussle on the way**_&#x20;

_Just like any onther family, we too go through rough days. Progess of the family has not only brought in happy times but also temporary bad actors, brutral remarks and alleging parties. It was a sight to be seen when the GATA family came in all together to face it all and to elminate the doubts of the resisting ones through concise explanations and reponses with love._
