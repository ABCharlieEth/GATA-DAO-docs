New _adventures_ are always exciting. We are working hard at building and approaching new ventures with intelligent and solid mindsets. Such has been the case with TERITORI, REBUS, and COSMOS HUB. These new validators are up and running through hardwork and from the support given to GATA.

Supporting pillars are crucial, and acknowledging them is also important. We show our appreciation through rewards. The reward system runs via tasks on Crew3, and list of awarded addresses is announced in the [channel](https://discord.com/invite/n2FWxvwWPE). Currently (today), winners of 3rd week have been announced, and GATA thinks that a regular reward distribution system is better due to which we shall distribute these rewards on 1st of coming month(s). This is consistent with out validators' income distribution to owners. _Be sure to check_ [_discord_](https://discord.com/invite/n2FWxvwWPE) _announcements for latest updates._&#x20;

Not all plans and expectations come to be true. We had high hopes and good past connection with the Sifchain, but some recent events have forced us to do the most rationale thing in best interest of the DAO. We will no longer be validating Sifchain from 30th Nov, 2022. The [propsal](../../gata-constitution/governance-proposal-10.md) no. 10 in this regard has been passed by DAO through on-chain vote. We are all sentimental about this but the right thing to do was done.

We do not sit idle. We simply cannot. An opportunity has appeared in the form of Game of Chains. We are up to grab it. GATA's $ATOM testnet validator is up and running ! _Check_ [_this_](https://discord.com/channels/934972959913820160/938799758544343041/1040198303419224094) _for details._

One of our members have developed a nice tool to check _rarity_ of your [GATAc](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/4a01c94c-9394-4933-8d35-f3a98048c0e0/page/aW92C) and [GATAv](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/143a3c90-8970-4b84-b05a-ed63df56be5f/page/p\_xn4vah4e0c). _Shoutout to the member._&#x20;
