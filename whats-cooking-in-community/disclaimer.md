**DISCLAIMER:** I**nvesting in yield-bearing NFTs** is highly speculative and carries a high degree of risk. The value of yield-bearing NFTs can be highly volatile and can fluctuate rapidly, and there may be limited liquidity. Yield-bearing NFTs are built on blockchain technology, which is still relatively new and untested, and there may be technology risks associated with the underlying technology. The regulatory environment for yield-bearing NFTs is still uncertain, and changes in laws and regulations could negatively impact their value. Yield-bearing NFTs often rely on decentralized finance protocols, which can be vulnerable to smart contract exploits, hacking, and other security risks.

It is important to thoroughly research and understand the underlying technology, economics, and risks associated with yield-bearing NFTs before investing. We strongly recommend that you only invest what you can afford to lose and that you diversify your investments across multiple assets. This disclaimer does not constitute financial or investment advice and you should always consult a financial professional before making any investment decisions.
