# Governance proposal 13

**GATA DAO Prop #13**

## Validator infrastructure Funding request

Hello GATA FAM!

GATA DAO is operating 12 Validtaors; Cosmos HUB, Juno, Osmosis, Evmos, Passage, Teritori, Nomic BTC, Akash, Neutron, Stride, Archway, and Omniflix. Some of these validators have been funded by the Treasury for 1 year since the start but others were not. Initially, the benchmark cost was \~500 USD a month for each node. Then GATA Team improved the model of node operations to reduce the cost of each node by \~400 USD to just around 100 USD each month.

At this point, we have infrastructure that can support 26 nodes. Currently, 12 Validator nodes and 12 sentry nodes are operational at all times, in addition to Relayers. The Validator fund was depleted in July 2023. Keeping an eye on the Market conditions GATA team has tried their best to not ask for the Funds from the treasury as Atom price for the last 2 years has been around 10 USD. Instead supported the operations from our own resources. But now at this point, we unfortunately cannot continue on our own and severely need to upgrade some of our Nodes and add better support for the others. For this, We need Roughly 20K USD At this point to support our considerably big operations for the next couple of quarters.

We propose to withdraw 1000 Atom From the treasury and 1800 Atom from Cosmos Validator self-bond. As per Felis update, Post **felis update**, it does not require governance to support validator operations but we find this communication and proposal important. Please give your thoughts on the idea, so that we can start the formal process of the voting.
