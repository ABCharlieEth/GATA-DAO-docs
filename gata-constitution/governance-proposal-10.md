# Governance proposal 10

**GATA DAO Prop #10**

**Shutting down the GATA Sifchain Validator**

Regarding the recent events about Sifchain Blockchain and accordingly to the sentiment of the whole DAO, this proposal aims at stopping our validator for this chain.

We gathered the sentiments of the community [here](https://discord.com/channels/934972959913820160/938623903796981770/1038128273802149948) to see what GATA community wants in this regard.&#x20;

**If this vote passes** _We will shut down the GATA Sifchain validator on 30th Nov 2022. Giving enough time to redelegate and unbond._\
&#x20;**If this vote fails** _We will keep our operations running on the Sifchain network._

Voting Basics -Voting will be on-chain by magic transaction so everyone can participate with confidentiality. (Stargaze chain to be used for the purpose) -To vote you need to do a magic transaction of 0.01 $Stars in the given address using Keplr. Along with your desired option in Memo field. For example :

if you want to vote for YES, write 1 in the memo. If you want to vote NO write 2 in memo. Address : stars1eewzan3pa6ta7jr83sqzujsgnaupkfs67e0ew3

\-Transaction must be sent from $GATA-c/$GATA-v holding account. One transaction per account. Vote weighs as much GATA in an account. If an account has 10 GATA you have 10 vote.\
