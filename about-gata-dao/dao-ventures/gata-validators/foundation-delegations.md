# Foundation delegations

Foundation delegation involves the action of a blockchain or cryptocurrency foundation allocating its tokens to validators or nodes within the network. In blockchain ecosystems that utilize Proof of Stake (PoS) or Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanisms, token holders can delegate their assets to enhance network security and governance while earning staking rewards. When a foundation holds a substantial amount of native tokens, it may strategically delegate these tokens to validators. This delegation serves multiple purposes, including reinforcing network security, incentivizing validators, fostering network growth, promoting decentralization, and contributing to token distribution. The specifics of foundation delegation can vary among blockchain projects, with the rules and processes typically outlined in the project's governance or economic model.
