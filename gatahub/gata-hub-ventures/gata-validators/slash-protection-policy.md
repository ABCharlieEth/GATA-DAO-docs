# Slash protection policy

## Slash protection policy

There are two types of slashings validator nodes might face:

&#x20; _-Downtime ( When the validator is unable to sign most of the blocks in the particular window)_

&#x20; _-Double signing (Double signing occurs when a validating entity (private key) submits two signed messages for the same block)_ \
\
**Coverage**

\-100% downtime slashing coverage in a maximum of 14-28 days. \
\-10% double signing coverage in a maximum of 14-28 days.&#x20;

_(we hope to increase the number in the future)_ \
\
Because every network has different slashing parameters, we cannot give you estimates but for $JUNO if you delegate 100 $JUNO to GATA HUB Validation, in case of downtime jail you will be slashed 0.01 JUNO and 5 $JUNO in case of Double signing slashing.\
\
**Refund-time**

14-28 days depending on the network from where we are unbounding to cover the loss. \
\
**Eligible Chains**

* **Evmos**
* **Juno**
* **Atom**
* **Teritori**
* **Omniflix**
