# Governance proposal 8

**DAO proposal #8 change in self-bond parameters**

After discussing it with the OG council over the past few weeks we are proposing the change in the self-bond mechanism. What is self-bond? When a Validator delegate to it's own node it is called self-bond.

Why GATA DAO is self bonding? After the GATA DAO governance prop #3 , it was approved by the DAO to self bond all the commission earned unless we reach 1.5% of self-bond ratio. for every 100 token staked we should have 1.5 token self staked.

The new proposed mechanism! Start the distribution mechanism, 5 days of commission and staking reward will go to self-bond and 25 days of commission and staking reward will be distributed to GATA holders each month.

**This formula will apply to**

* $Evmos validator immediately. -$JUNO validator when we reach 500 $JUNO self bond -$NOM validator when we reach 500 $NOM self-bond -$Rowan validator when we reach 30K $Rowan self-bond -Upcoming $ATOM validator when we reach 500 $Atom self-bond

Next vote on this When self-bond ratio drops to 0.5% or goes above 3% for any GATA validator
