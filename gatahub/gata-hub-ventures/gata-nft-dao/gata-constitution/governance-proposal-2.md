# Governance proposal 2

Hello to @everyone, The next few weeks are going to be full of surprises, we have a lot of things to propose to you.

Let's start with the second vote of the DAO. As we were able to discuss together during our exchange with all the members of the DAO, here is our proposal:

Voting Basics

1. Voting will be on-chain by magic transaction so everyone can participate with confidentiality. (Stargaze chain to be used for the purpose)
2. To vote you need to do a magic transaction of 0.01 $Stars in the given address using Keplr. Along with your desired option in Memo field. For example : if you want to vote for YES, write 1 in the memo. If you want to vote NO write 2 in memo. Address : stars1eewzan3pa6ta7jr83sqzujsgnaupkfs67e0ew3
3. Transaction must be sent from $GATA holding account. \*One transaction per account. Vote weighs as much GATA in an account. If an account has 10 GATA. Vote power would be 10/950

Proposal #2 (48h to vote):

Request for collect 5000$ equivalent from the DAO fund to run EVMOS and NOM validator. This money will be used to fund the launch of the two validators before they are fully financially self-sufficient.

Proposal #3 and Proposal #4 will take place after this one (48h each) You have until April 28, 2022 12:00 PM to vote
