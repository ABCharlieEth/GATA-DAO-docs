# Governance proposal 6

**DAO Proposal # 6**

Formal request to compound the rewards of our validator for a period of time.

Compounding our rewards every day on our validator allows for improving the efficiency of the capital. During a bear market, it's something we should do.

Here are the wallets of each validator with funds:

[GATA DAO Sifchain Validator\
](https://www.mintscan.io/sifchain/account/sif1u453cen62m939v548nfql54zl886a9zyh2qgqs)[GATA DAO EVMOS Validator ](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/account/evmos1w9m6p7ctu4gkdsr8plle997h25rzsa96t3deuk)\
[GATA DAO JUNO Validator](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1yeaw3dv6jk3hr290l2tsew7rr2vjykynyy83tn)&#x20;

&#x20;No Data for now for nomic on mintscan, probably next week. (All the validators need at least 1.5% of the total amount to be Slashed protected, this is the reason why some of our tokens are staked.)

We have proposed to the OG to think about the distribution of the rewards. The choices were as follows:

* compound for a time.
* Compound up to a threshold.
* Do not compound.

They chose the first version.

Three proposals have emerged: 1 - Compound on a duration of 1 month and revote in one month 2 - Compound on a duration of 2 months and revote in 2 months. 3 - Not compound

Voting Basics -Voting will be on-chain by magic transaction so everyone can participate with confidentiality. (Stargaze chain to be used for the purpose) -To vote you need to do a magic transaction of 0.01 $Stars in the given address using Keplr. Along with your desired option in Memo field. For example :

If you want to vote for the first proposal, write 1 in the memo. If you want to vote for the second proposal, write 2 in the memo. If you want to vote for the third proposal, write 3 in the memo.
