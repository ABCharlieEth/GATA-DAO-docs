# Governance proposal 4

After early discussion with the DAO members on the topic #deleted-channel here are the voting basics and proposal :

GATA DAO Proposal #4 Use all the GATAc royalties (including team part) we have in the wallet so far (\~ 23k stars) to buy the GATAc and keep these NFTs for future stargaze staking system / Contest / Giveaway / Auction. Those NFTs would be kept in the DAO treasury Wallet and the DAO will decide how to use them in the future.

Those GATAc held in the DAO treasury; -Will not participate in the DAO votes. -Will not be listed in the market (Unless DAO decides it) -Won't receive DAO rewards.

If you are okay with that write 1 in the memo to vote YES If you are against that, write 2 in the memo to vote NO

A second proposal, regarding the possible regular purchase of our NFTs for a period of 1 to 3 months, will come later, but for the moment it still needs to be discussed.

Voting Basics -Voting will be on-chain by magic transaction so everyone can participate with confidentiality. (Stargaze chain to be used for the purpose) -To vote you need to do a magic transaction of 0.01 $Stars in the given address using Keplr. Along with your desired option in Memo field. For example :

if you want to vote for YES, write 1 in the memo. If you want to vote NO write 2 in memo. Address : stars1eewzan3pa6ta7jr83sqzujsgnaupkfs67e0ew3

\-Transaction must be sent from $GATA holding account. One transaction per account. Vote weighs as much GATA in an account. If an account has 10 GATA. Vote power would be 10/950

Voting Starts 21:30 UTC May 25, 2022- Voting Ends 21:30 UTC May 27,2022
