**DAO proposal # 7**

Proposal for GATA DAO to start validation operations on Cosmos

\-With the intrachain security (ICS)  coming on the Cosmos hub first and to the other chains built on Cosmos SDK. The need for the GATA DAO's cosmos hub validator to remain relevant in the Validator network is increasing.

\-We are still in partnership discussion to get major Atom delegations that we might need to get into the active validator set (\~40K $Atom), but as the snapshot campaign has been proven good for EVMOS and JUNO validator we want to take advantage of the campaign which is ending in \~6 weeks.

1. **Yes**
2. **No**

The Team is seeking $5K or equivalent from DAO treasury in case the proposal passes in favor of running cosmos validator.
