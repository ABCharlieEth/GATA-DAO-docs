# Governance proposal 3

**GATA DAO Prop 3**

Proposal to self-delegate and maintain 1.5%, of the total delegation to our validators existing and upcoming

It is an important validator practice to self-bond a certain % of tokens to own validator, to get delegators trust, and to get foundation delegation. (Some chains offer foundation delegation where they delegate the teamâ€™s coin to a set of validators who fulfill  the certain criteria, self-bonding is an important criterion in that regard as well)

For example; We have 1,114,831 ROWAN delegated to our GATA Validator. 1.5% of this would be 16722 ROWAN.

\-The staking reward will also go to the revenue wallet and will be distributed to the GATA holders with the same proportion. -We will only use commission earned + self-delegation staking rewards to achieve this goal. -If the self-delegation ratio gets higher than the desired % in case of major un-bonding, Dev will not un-delegate the self-bonded assets.
