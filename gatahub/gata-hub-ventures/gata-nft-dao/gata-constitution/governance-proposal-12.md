# Governance proposal 12

**GATA DAO Prop #12**

**Shutting down GATA Rebus chain Validator**

According to the sentiment of the GATA DAO, this proposal aims at stop our validator operations for Rebus chain.

We gathered the sentiment of the community beforehand, to see what the GATA fam wants, here: https://discord.com/channels/934972959913820160/938623903796981770/1127320964305276948

**If this vote passes**  We will shut down the GATA Rebuschain validator on 20th of August 2023. Giving all delegators enough time to redelegate or to unbound.

**If this vote fails** We will keep our operations running on Rebus chain.

**Voting Basics** \
&#x20;• Voting will be on-chain by magic transaction so everyone can participate with confidentiality (Stargaze chain to be used for the purpose).\
&#x20;• To cast your vote you need to do a magic transaction of 0.01 $STARS along with your desired voting option in the transaction's memo field. \
For example: \
• if you want to vote for YES, write 1 in the memo field. \
• if you want to vote NO, write 2 in the memo field.

• Transaction must be sent from the wallet that holds your Colonial Cats (GATAc) and/or Voyager Cats (GATAv) NFT(s). One transaction per account. Vote weight depends on the amount of GATA held in the account (e.g.: if you have 3 GATAc & 7 GATAv, you have 10 GATAs in your wallet, which gets you 10 votes).
