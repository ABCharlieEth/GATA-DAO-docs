# Governance proposal 9

**DAO proposal #9 Proposing the $TORI Airdrop management**

_Note this prop is dependent on the promised future event of airdrop from the TORI team, and we cannot confirm the execution of this prop at this point, GATA team will execute this proposal if passed as soon as we get the airdrop in the treasury_

First of all we want to thank Teritori team for airdroping a generous amount to GATA holders. The GATA treasury will get 557\*300 = 167100 TORI. And we aim to get best out of it for that team is proposing the following.

1- Send 15K TORI to GATA Teritori validator for self bonding purpose, it will be used in to cover the slashing events. currently we have \~318K Tori delegated to our Validator and we hope these delegetaions will increase after the GATA holders will receive their Airdrop. 1.5% is intended self bond ratio for expected 1 million Tori delegations.

2- Staking 50K Tori from the treasury for a long-term. -it is a good gesture from us that we are helping in securing the TORI network. -Because it will be delegated to our GATA validator, it will increase the monthly payouts for GATA holders.

3- Selling the 5K USD equivalent of TORI to fund the TORI validator. \~22K TORI (at current price)

Remaining $TORI

130K $TORI ( 50K Staked from treasury + 80K Available ) 15K $TORI self-bond from validator

(Stargaze chain to be used for the purpose) -To vote you need to do a magic transaction of 0.01 $Stars in the given address using Keplr. Along with your desired option in Memo field. For example :

if you want to vote for YES, write 1 in the memo. If you want to vote NO write 2 in memo. Address : stars1eewzan3pa6ta7jr83sqzujsgnaupkfs67e0ew3
