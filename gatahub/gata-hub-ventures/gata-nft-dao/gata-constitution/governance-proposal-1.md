# Governance proposal 1

Hello @everyone

After the discussion around the proposal, we are moving to the first DAO proposal.

**Voting Basics**

1. Voting will be on-chain by magic transaction so everyone can participate with confidentiality. (Stargaze chain to be used for the purpose)
2. Each $GATA represents one vote, there are 950 $GATA held by the community so there are 950 Votes in total. (49 GATA held by DAO for distribution to qualified users won't have voted for now)
3. To vote you need to do a magic transaction of 0.01 $Stars in the given address using Keplr. Along with your desired option in the memo field. For example, if you want to vote for opt 2, write 2 in the memo, If you want to vote on 1 and 2 write 1,2 in the memo. Address stars1eewzan3pa6ta7jr83sqzujsgnaupkfs67e0ew3
4. The transaction must be sent from $GATA holding account. \*One transaction per account. Vote weighs as much GATA in an account. If an account has 10 GATA. Vote power would be 10/950 (edited) \[2:42 AM]

Team's perspective: -Most important objective for us all should be to start generating rewards for DAO and GATA holders. The longer we wait, the more we miss. This is just the start, not the END! We also need to expand as is Cosmos every day. At the same time we need to be realistic, act smart and not just waste our funds/time/energy on unrealistic/unreasonable objectives. Look what we have, what we are doing and what we plan to do as a community. -Regarding Activation of validators, team is quite optimistic about delegation support from within community and through various future activities. All proposed validators if run and activated could generate rewards for each GATA equivalent of the GATA launch price per month. (Just an estimate, could be even lower or much higher) -The team has put extensive research and work behind this proposal and we feel this is the best for DAO and its objectives in every aspect at this time. -We are connected directly or indirectly to core teams of the above-proposed chains, in case we come across any issues we have the required support at our disposal.

In addition, GATA DAO is planning to send Colonial Cats farthest into Stars, launching another NFT collection on Stargaze. Also someday deep into Cosmos at a later stage. A detailed announcement will be made in the coming weeks as soon as everything is finalized. The only certainty at this point is the Gen mint participants (GATA holders) will be incentivized for being the early believers, as we wish to keep our every promise. Consider this an early half announcement as we wish to run GATA Validators successfully before the next NFT launch.&#x20;

\-We feel the above information is important and should be shared with the community to make the right decision. Please vote and make it count as there are only 950 votes! -Please remember, this is only the team's personal perspective with all the information at our disposal. You have 48hrs to DYOR and vote accordingly. -The team does not serve individuals. Our loyalty and sincerity serve the DAO and the community as a whole. Thank you.\
