The GATA DAO has been formed to own and operate cosmos validator(s) which in fact are and will be property of the DAO. So, by owning a GATA NFT you are either own or are founding a validator that gives you earning (the utility) derived from running the validator in proportion to your NFT ownership. This is in addition to the value of the art that the owners would hold. Furthermore, the utility also includes royalties derived from a share of trading fee of NFTs on the market place. Therefore, the NFT holders enjoy the benefit of community engagement via running the DAO, earning from validator(s) set up, royalties and collection mints.
